    <h1>SIMPLE GIT PRACTICE</h1>
    <p>
        I AM LEARNING GIT AND GIT HUB AT VSASF TECH ICT ACADEMY, ENUGU. <br>
        I LEARNT HOW TO CREATE HTML FILES USING GIT AND EDIT THE FILE
         CONTENT USING VS CODE TEXT EDITOR.
    </p>
    <p>
        LEARNING GIT WHICH IS A VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM IS VERY INTERESTING. <br>
        TODAY I LEARNT HOW TO PUSH MY LOCAL REPO TO REMOTE REPO USING GITHUB. <br>
        GIT AND GITHUB ARE SO MUCH EASY TO LEARN AND WORK WITH.
